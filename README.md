# TetriZimoslaw
 Tetris-like game for arduino
 
 Everything is displayed with u8g2 library on 128x64 px monochrome LCD.
 
 For controlling there are 6 buttons (INPUT_PULLUP mode):
 - Left
 - Right
 - Hard drop
 - Soft drop
 - Rotate Right
 - Rotate Left

 You can pause the game by pushing hard drop and soft drop buttons at the same time. The same is for unpausing
 
 I tried to fully mimic original tetris rules, but some things may be different.
 
 File "cabling_scheme.pdf" contains connections scheme between Arduino Uno, LCD and buttons.
